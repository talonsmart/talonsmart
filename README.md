# Hello ðŸ‘‹

Hello and thanks for viewing my profile. I have 9+ years of experience in full stack web development, and have worked as a software engineer at Netflix and Walgreens. It's been quite a journey and I've accomplished a lot, such as increased total page traffic for previous employers by 18-22%. I've refactored and reworked many codebases to increase performance and improve the UI/UX of many apps.  Experienced with React, Angular and Vue on the front-end and Flask, Node and Django on the backend. Can write mobile apps in Flutter and Kotlin By optimizing UI/UX and DevOps, My full portfolio can be found [here](https://talonsmart.github.io)

## Previous Experience
### Netflix
- Improved SPA frontend with React, Redux and TypeScript, boosting user engagement by 25.7%.
- Created app prototyping in Figma, speeding up development time.
- Implemented REST APIs for React Native, and enabled real-time socket.io updates and 0Auth with JWTs.
- Collaborated with UI/UX designers using SASS and webpack.
- Utilized Git and Github CI/CD for automated build and deployment.
- Containerized their web application microservices using Docker and Linux administration.
- Increased Unit testing and test automation by implementing Jest unit tests and Playwright E2E tests.

### Walgreens
- Assisted e-commerce platform development using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, TypeScript, Django and PostgreSQL.
- Implemented a product recommendation engine in Python and the UI in React Native, using AJAX queries.
- Developed REST APIs to seamlessly integrate the e-commerce platform with third-party payment gateways.
- Created Playwright and Jest unit tests for stable app development.
- Linux server administration using Bash and shell scripting.
- Developed Electron desktop app with Node.js, increasing user engagement.
- Participant in Agile Scrum teams, contributing to daily stand-ups and sprint planning.

## Skills
### Front-End
I'm experienced with all 3 popular JavaScript frameworks: React, Angular and Vue. All 3 of them are amazing and a lot of quality software has been written with them. They've helped speed up websites I've written on this GitHub, because everything is already rendered in the web browser, leading to a much faster and nicer experience for the end user. With all of those frameworks, I've used TypeScript to ensure all JavaScript code is staticly typed to catch errors before they hit runtime, combined with tools like Esbuild and Webpack to minify the code and ensure seamless compatibility across web browser. I know all core JavaScript APIs, and know how to communicate with APIs via the JS Fetch API and Axios. For all webpage styling, I use SCSS, a CSS preprocessor which adds a lot of niceties to CSS, which can easily be added to any SPA web framework.

Using these tools have helped create amazing websites for 2 great companies (Netflix and Walgreens), and they are amazing for personal projects as well. 

### Back-end / Web Servers
For both employment opportunities, I've used Node.JS and Django for server-side development. Both are amazing in different ways. Django is much more batteries-included and it's easy to write an application quickly in it with a great language (Python). Node.JS on the other hand is a lot more DIY, where you start from scratch and add tools as you need them (although there are tools like Nest.JS). Both have worked amazingly for making fast, high-quality web applications that users enjoy, and I have about equal experience with both, they're both second-nature working with them for so long. The Node.JS framework I've worked with the most is Express due to its popularity, though I've used Fastify and NestJS as well. 

I can do DevOps and Linux server administation, in fact it's preferable to use IaaS in most cases because it's cheaper than Vercel. This comes at the cost of being good with Linux Administration (such as Ubuntu,Debian and Fedora), which I've learned and am good at, along with using tools like Ansible and Terraform to automate the workflow and save hours of time. Using Docker and Kubernetes has helped a lot as well, making it easy to set up microservices and run multiple containerized workers for an app. 

As for data, I've worked with REST and GraphQL. Both have benefits over the other. REST is a lot simpler and widely-used, where as GraphQL sends less data to the client so it has performance benefits for larger apps.

### Team Collaboration
For both jobs I've worked at, they used an Agile + Scrum development system. This is a development methodology where you focus on small increments of change that essentially build up over time, making it so developers can stay focused and react to what their users want. Scrum goes along nicely with Agile, focusing on great team collaboration and ensuring a lot of work is done in a short amount of tie.  

### UI / UX Design
UI / UX design is extremely important. You can have the most powerful app in the world, but if users don't know how to use it, they typically won't. I've studies User Interface design a lot and learned a lot from working at Netflix, and have been able to vastly improve the usage of mobile apps simply by changing the UI to be more user-friendly. I'm experienced in tools like Photoshop and Illustrator for making icons and svgs for websites. 

### Dev Tooling
I've worked with almot every dev utility under the sun. Git along with Github/Gitlab are a must for any developer, they make it so easy for multiple devs to work on one project. VSCode is also a must, it's the easiest and most reliable code editor and has lots of extensions to make development easier. My main system is a high-end laptop with Windows 11.
